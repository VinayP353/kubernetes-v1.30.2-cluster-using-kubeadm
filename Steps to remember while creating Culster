3 instances (1 master (2cpu, 4 GB), 2 worker (1cpu, 2 GB))
Edit INBOUBD rules in both master and worker
For master and worker nodes (check in the kubernetes documentation)
follow the installation steps unitll the step 9 in all three nodes and make sure to change the step 7 from (nano to vi) 
step 10 should be run only on master node and copy the kubeadm join command.
then paste this kubeadm join command on the both worker nodes to join.
